**List of SCs**: rplanet, a.rplanet, (tbd)


Here is a types of tasks we are currently working on and implementing:
**UI Enhancements:** Addressing user interface issues to improve navigation and user experience.
**Bug Fixes:** Correcting typos and resolving other minor issues to ensure smooth gameplay.
**Feature Development:** Introducing new features aimed at enhancing game balance and accessibility for newcomers. 

Changelog:

__Quest System (Progression + Daily)__

To enhance long-term engagement, we are introducing a structured quest system. Players will have both progression quests and daily challenges that reward consistent activity.

__Deeper Map Interactions__

The world of R-Planet is vast, and we are adding new points of interest on the map to enhance strategic and tactical gameplay. Players will be able to engage in special missions or face unexpected challenges, making exploration more rewarding.

__Inventory System__

Managing in-game assets effectively is key to success. We plan to redesign the inventory screen, making it easier to store, organize, and manage all owned and collected items and boosters in one place. Streamlining inventory management will help players to optimize their gameplay strategies and maintain better control over their assets.

__Hero Level-Up & Skill Upgrade__

We are reworking the experience system to make hero progression more dynamic and rewarding. More heroes will be introduced, each with a unique set of empowered properties that can be upgraded over time. Players will be able to customize their heroes through upgrades and new gear items, developing specialized strategies based on their hero’s powers.

__More Hero Items__

The hero equipment system is being expanded to introduce more gear items with varying levels of influence on the hero, the base to which the hero is attached, and their army. Players will have access to items of different rarities. This expansion aims to deepen character customization and strategy, giving players more control over their heroes’ strengths.

__Rewarded Ads__

Players will have the opportunity to earn in-game boosters and benefits by watching ads. This feature will be optional and designed to provide additional resources without disrupting gameplay. The system will allow players to gain advantages without direct purchases, ensuring a balanced and accessible approach to in-game progression.

__Engagement Chest__

To reward long-term play, we are introducing an engagement chest system. The longer players stay active in the game, the more rewards they can receive. Scaling rewards will make extended play sessions more satisfying, reinforcing player engagement.
