### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>

1. On Jan 13 we've suffered from a major DDOS attach from various asian countries that mostly comprised from IPv6 addresses which temporarily deceived CF heuristics.
We've fended off the attack eventually, but it created a 5 hour gap in some of our services uptime.
2. On Jan 16 there was an issue with mainnet BP host which was randomly restarted and the BP was automatically migrated, though creating 3 missed rounds for us.
