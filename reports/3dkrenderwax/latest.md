### Rada Quest (Trading Card Game)

**URLs**: https://radaquest.net, https://game.radaquest.net

**List of SCs**: radaquesttcg, radaunpacker, radarentmain, tarukofficer

**Update**:

These are some of the internal statistics of the game. We have noticed a strong increase in card recycling activities (burning NFTs). This causes an increase in the scarcity of game cards, which benefits our ecosystem.

Another positive fact is the constant influx of new players. Even though the numbers are small, they keep the game active.

|                | Nov 24 | Dec 24 | Jan 25 |
| -------------- | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| New Players    |    199 |    158 |    298 |
| Recicled Cards |  3,420 |  2,213 |  2,842 |
| Arena Battles  | 58,506 | 83,464 | 44,585 |
| Gems Plays     | 10,244 |  8,660 |  8,915 |

> Note: Arena battles are heavily dependent on the seasonality of campaigns, so significant differences can be seen from one month to another.

As we have warned on other occasions, over time we have reduced as much as possible the need for users to sign transactions, so statistics such as DappRadar should only be taken as a guide regarding the evolution of the game.

In the latest evaluations Rada Quest has been penalized with decay. We want to show our disagreement with this measure and we want to argue for it.

If we check the statistics of Rada Quest on DappRadar from 6 months ago, or 1 year ago, we can see that our position in the ranking was around 25th place. If we look at the current statistics, it is true that there is a drop in the supposed number of unique monthly players (indicative data due to what was mentioned above) but our game has improved its position placing itself around 15th place in the ranking of WAX games. This is not good news overall, since it is easily deduced that the WAX ​​ecosystem is suffering a lot, but it is positive news for us since it shows that our game, Rada Quest, is withstanding the bad streak of the WAX ​​ecosystem more solvently than other games. We consider that penalizing one of the few games that remain active and that is in the top 15 of the table is not a good incentive.

We would like to take this opportunity to remind you that this project is 100% self-funded. In addition, we continue to support the promotion of artists by including new cards with more illustrations by artists such as Catrynart or Triz Draw. These are some examples of the new cards:

We would like to be able to provide more value to the WAX ​​gaming ecosystem, but budget limitations are significant and the lack of support from the OIG through decay penalties does not help either.

More updates on next reports.

**Development update**

We are continuing to develop a new version of our game to facilitate access for both off-chain players and mobile devices.
