### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Our transition from dfuse to our new stack of Pinax data services is complete. dfuse had been sunset and all users have migrated to a brand new suite of data services, including our [WAX Firehose & Substreams](https://pinax.network/en/chain/wax), [WAX token and transaction APIs](https://wax.api.pinax.network), and custom-built subgraphs on The Graph, including [WAX Transactions](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/4bAe7NA8b6J14ZfZr3TXfzzjjSoGECTFuqv7CwnK1zzg?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one), [WAX Tokens](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/6Tt5mHVNDyAo3KbsYMUeemmzs2381vXUquXw75EnG9cW?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one), [Alien Worlds](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/4UETM9eMQ4Y4otae5sjJscniNhmDUhCDwWTfXm6Tpm14?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one), and [Farmers World](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/3eMDCbB9JBiherY33aC6e5gGUbuMYLA8xKFwEC27mSkz?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one). 

As core developers on The Graph (under our Pinax brand), we've developed a [new networks registry for The Graph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/networks-registry) that includes WAX, which has enabled our [WAX subgraphs to be natively discoverable in The Graph explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer?indexedNetwork=wax), making it easier for developers to discover and leverage WAX data in their projects. The new network registry has also been integrated with [The Graph Tooling](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling), making it easy for any WAX developer to develop and deploy new WAX subgraphs to The Graph. 

Our team has also been working on a new data service for data analysts called datasets. We recently published our [WAX datasets to the Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZ33VCBE/pinax-wax-raw-blockchain-data?search=wax), bringing WAX data to a platform familliar to millions of traditional data analysts in a format they're comfortable working with. Our goal with datasets is to bring WAX blockchain data to a new market of data analytists who are new to the blockchain space and not familiar with blockchain data indexing tooling. You can learn more about our datasets in some of our recent blog posts (which include videos): [Blockchain Data Analysis Made Easy with Pinax Datasets and Snowflake](https://blog.pinax.network/pinax/blockchain-data-analysis-made-easy-with-pinax-datasets-and-snowflake/) and [Save Time and Unlock Insights Sooner with Pinax Blockchain Datasets](https://blog.pinax.network/pinax/save-time-and-unlock-insights-sooner-with-pinax-blockchain-datasets/).
