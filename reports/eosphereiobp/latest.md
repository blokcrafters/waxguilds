**Update**: 
If you are technically curious or interested in running services on the WAX network, be sure to have a look at our WAX Technical How To series published monthly in the EOSphere Blog on Medium.

These guides are being added to the WAX Developer GitHub.

This month we added a Guide on how to configure and deploy Antelope Firewall. Antelope Firewall created by Animus Labs Ltd has a host of features that make it simple to load balance and implement policies to restrict specific types of nodeos requests.
