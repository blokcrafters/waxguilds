*[...Describe issues you faced last month and if any noteworthy update/upgrade of hardware/software happended.]*

Both of our mainnet ship nodes had issues on Jan 4, affected Hyperion, AA, and a couple custom indexers. Half of that was fixed within ~8 hours, the other one is about to be up to date in a few hours (total issue < 24h).

### YouTube Live Streams

Weekly live streams on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MikeDCrypto/streams). P.S. I realize it is called the "WaxFusion Show" but a majority of the stream time is spent engaging people about WAX in general, talking to guests, etc. The discussions have been really helpful and engaging for the overall ecosystem.

### DefiLlama Initiative

- [Submitted R-Planet](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/pull/13559) to DefiLlama

### <ins>Feedback to OIG</ins>
*[valuable feedback for the WAX OIG around the topics governance, guidelines, ...]*

- Please consider having an open discussion about my [RFP issue](https://github.com/wax-office-of-inspector-general/WAX-RFP/issues/8). If possible, I would prefer to have the IGs on my YouTube channel for this discussion as it would allow me to lead the conversation and avoid extra noise (anyone interested can still ask questions and give feedback in the live chat). It would also engage normal users more than the google meet setting would.
