### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
We continued work on upgrading our mainnet infrastructure to handle more requests and for mainnet block production while releasing Urdu translations for Anyo Academy's courses. This month we were mainly focused on working on some long term projects still in development.

**Update**:
We wrote a tutorial on how to set up Pinax's WAX Token API by restoring from a ClickHouse database backup we began providing. Instead of taking weeks to index from Substreams as we have experienced firsthand, restoring from our database backup with all the blocks already indexed saves weeks of time and money.

**Update**: 
We released our Urdu translations for Anyo Academy's courses. While Urdu has double the amount of German speakers and the same amount of French speakers worldwide, there are no resources in Urdu regarding WAX. In the long term, we hope to bring crypto to the masses and have WAX be the chain of choice in South East Asia.
